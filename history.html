        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>It all started when Neo found out her daughter had celiac disorder and was also lactose intolerant while she was a baby, so Neo started baking gluten-free and vegan cakes.</p>
        <p>The cakes, especially the cupcakes were such a huge success, Neo decided to start selling them so everybody with food restrictions could still have their cake and eat it too!</p>
